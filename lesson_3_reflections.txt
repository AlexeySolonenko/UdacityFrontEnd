When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

1) When work may need a remote backup. I.e. backup in case of local hardware failure.
2) When work may need access from multiple locations.
3) When work may need to be accessed by several workers.
4) When work may need to be puclicly avaialble and shared.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 As far as I understand, Git is a tool for manual version control. A human being is to decide when to performe manual commits. Otherwise, automatic commits will take over the control of the work. It will overwrite the work of the programmer.
